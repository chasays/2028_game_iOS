# 2048 Game with iCloud History

This is a complete implementation of the 2048 game with history tracking and iCloud synchronization.

## Features
- Complete 2048 game implementation with swipe controls
- Game history tracking with local storage
- iCloud synchronization using CloudKit
- Statistics display (best score, average score, total games)
- Sync status indicators

## iCloud Configuration Required

To use the iCloud features, you need to configure the project in Xcode:

1. **Enable iCloud Capability**:
   - Open the project in Xcode
   - Select your project target
   - Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Click the "+" button and add "iCloud"
   - Check "CloudKit" in the Services section

2. **Configure iCloud Containers**:
   - In the iCloud capability, ensure a container is selected
   - The default container (iCloud.$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)) should work

3. **Set Team and Bundle Identifier**:
   - Make sure you have a valid Apple Developer Team selected
   - Set an appropriate Bundle Identifier in the project settings

4. **Entitlements**:
   - The entitlements file has been created but needs to be properly linked in Xcode
